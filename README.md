**FCPPE-Net: Calibrating the Principal Point of Vehicle-Mounted Fisheye Cameras Using Point-Oriented Representation**  
[IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL, 2024]

## Overview

FCPPE-Net is a lightweight and accurate deep learning framework for **self-calibrating the principal point** of vehicle-mounted **fisheye cameras** in unconstrained driving scenarios. The model is based on a novel **Point-Oriented Representation**, which encodes geometric priors and enhances feature sensitivity to projection distortions near the principal point.
